* FastAPI Application Documentation**


This FastAPI application is a comprehensive tool designed to aid real estate agents in streamlining their workflow. The application integrates advanced features like AI-driven email assistance, client management, and market analysis tools.

**Running the FastAPI Application:**

To start the application, you need to have FastAPI and Uvicorn installed. Uvicorn is an ASGI server implementation, which serves as the gateway to making your FastAPI application available for web requests.

1. **Install FastAPI and Uvicorn (if not already installed):**
   ```bash
   pip install fastapi uvicorn
   ```

2. **Run the Application:**
   Navigate to the directory where your FastAPI application file (e.g., `main.py`) is located, and run the following command in your terminal:
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:AIemail --reload
   ```
   - `main`: The file name of your FastAPI application (without the `.py` extension).
   - `AIemail`: The instance of the FastAPI application in your `main.py` file.
   - `--reload`: Enables auto-reload so the server will restart upon code changes. This is useful for development but should be omitted in a production environment.

3. **Accessing the API:**
   Once running, you can access the API at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. The API provides various endpoints, including:
   - `/`: A simple greeting endpoint.
   - `/email-Query`: Endpoint to process email queries using AI and Gmail integration.
   - `/Catch-Me-UP`: Endpoint to get a summary of recent emails.
